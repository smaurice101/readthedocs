TML Core Technology Integration
================================

Apache Kafka
--------------

Apache Kafka is the world's largest open source platform for storage of real-time data streams.   TML integrates with `Apache Kafka on-premise <https://kafka.apache.org/>`_ or in the cloud using `AWS MSK <https://aws.amazon.com/msk/features/>`_ or `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/>`_.

Apache Airflow
----------------

`Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. It started at Airbnb in October 2014[2] as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.

TML Solution Studio Container uses Airflow to build highly advanced, scalable, real-time TML solutions. Refer to :ref:`TML Solution Studio Container` for more details.

TML Binaries
-----------

TML uses THREE (3) core binaries: Viper, HPDE, Viperviz, for TML solutions.  More details here :ref:`1. TML Components: Three Binaries`

TML Python Library
-----------

TML solutions are built with the `MAADSTML Python Libary <https://pypi.org/project/maadstml/>`_.  Refer to :ref:`MAADSTML Python Library API` for more details.

Docker
-----------

TML solutions are containerized using `Docker <https://hub.docker.com/>`_.

Kubernetes
--------------

TML solution containers are scaled with `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_.

Github
--------

TML solutions are tightly integrated with `Github <https://github.com/>`_ and can commit code locally and to remote branches directly from the TML Solution Studio container.  Refer to :ref:`TML Solution Studioâ€™s Tight Integration with GitHub`.

Python and DAGs (Directed Acylic Graphs)
-----------

All TML solutions are written using Pre-written `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ DAGs: see the :ref:`DAG Table`.  Refer to :ref:`TML Solutions Can Be Built In 10 Steps Using Pre-Written DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)`.
