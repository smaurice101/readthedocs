Apache Kafka
--------------

Apache Kafka is the world's largest open source platform for storage of real-time data streams.   TML integrates with `Apache Kafka on-premise <https://kafka.apache.org/>`_ or in the cloud using `AWS MSK <https://aws.amazon.com/msk/features/>`_ or `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/>`_.

`Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. It started at Airbnb in October 2014[2] as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.

TML Solution Studio Container uses Airflow to build highly advanced, scalable, real-time TML solutions. Refer to :ref:`TML Solution Studio Container` for more details.
