TML Real-Time Dashboards
=========================

You can create real-time dashboards using TML binary called **Viperviz**

.. note::

   Viperviz streams data **directly** from the **Docker Container** to the client browser.  Viperviz binary uses websockets to stream data to the browser.  This 
   means you do not need a third-party visualization tool.

Some sample dashboards samples are below.
