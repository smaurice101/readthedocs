TML Performs Entity Level Machine Learning and Processing
========================================================

What does entity level processing and machine learning mean? 
-----------------------

An entity is any device or object that produces real-time data.  TML processes data from **individual devices or objects**.  This means TML can create machine learning models for each invidual device.

.. important:: 

   The power of real-time entity based processing and machine learning means that if there are **1 million devices generating data, TML can create 1 million machine 
   learning models for each device**.

   Because each device or object operates in its own environment - by processing each device invidually - TML offers a much deeper understanding of the behaviour of 
   that device, and therefore able to **predict the future behaviours** of that device more accurately.
