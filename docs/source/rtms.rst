How TML Maintains Past Memory of Events Using Sliding Time Windows
============================================

* The growth of real-time data according to IDC Research will reach 30% of global data in 2025 or roughly 90 ZB or 90 trillion gigabytes mainly from IoT devices connected to the Internet

* This raises concerns and opportunities to process real-time data with Transactional Machine Learning (TML)

* The major concern with real-time streaming data from connected devices is the risk of Cybersecurity attacks

* Cyber crime is expected to cost the global economy $10.7 Trillion in 2025 and this number is growing

* This makes Cyber crime prevention and mitigation a Top Priority for global organizations regardless of size

* TML presents a powerful method of detecting, mitigating and preventing cyber attacks at the entity level by “remembering” past events in past sliding time windows and quantifies this by computing three scores:

   * **Attack Score (AS):** Quantifies the attack vector.  Higher number, more likely attack is occurring
  
   * **Pattern Score (PS):** Quantifies the pattern vector.  Higher number, more likely a pattern in the attack
  
   * **Real-Time Memory Score (RTMS):** Combines both the Attack and Pattern Scores for an OVERALL score
